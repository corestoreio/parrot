## Features

## Try it out

The easiest way to get started is using `docker` and `docker-compose`. Simply clone this repo, navigate to the root of it and start the services:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/anthonynsimon/parrot.git
$ cd parrot
$ ./scripts/buildweb.sh
$ sudo ./scripts/start.sh
```

> Please note that to build the web app, `npm` and `angular-cli`are required:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This will build the web app and launch 3 containers: a Postgres **database**, the Parrot **API server** and Nginx as the **reverse proxy and static file server**.

Navigate to https://localhost/api/v1/ping and you should be able to see if the API is up (your browser will complain about an unknown certificate, see the HTTPS notice below for more info).

And to view the web app simply navigate to https://localhost, it should open the login page of the web app.

### Important note on HTTPS

For convinience, self-signed SSL certificates are provided for the reverse-proxy (nginx). Do **NOT** use them for anything other than development,
use your own certificates instead. We recommended automating the generation and renewal of the certificates via Let's Encrypt.
The `/etc/nginx/certs` and `/etc/nginx/vhost.d` volumes on the nginx container have been made available for this purpose.

If you deploy the API server on your own, be sure to serve it behind a secure reverse-proxy or another secure method.
